# Student Performance Dashboard 

## Project Overview

This project is a **Power BI dashboard** built to analyze **student academic performance, attendance impact, and demographic factors**. The dashboard is designed as a **single-page, interactive, and export-ready report**, suitable for academic analysis, presentations, and portfolio showcasing.

The primary objective is to understand:

* How students perform across core subjects
* Pass vs fail trends by grade level
* The impact of attendance on outcomes
* Performance variations by gender and grade
